# AGI Thinking (Ladybug)

This folder contains the cognitive layer that replaces LangGraph.

## Philosophy

- **LangGraph**: thinking = control flow + state mutation
- **Ladybug**: thinking = resonance propagation under epistemic constraints

## Files to migrate from ada-consciousness

Priority 1:
- `thought_kernel.py` - Core cognitive loop
- `active_inference.py` - Predictive processing
- `progressive_awareness.py` - Awareness levels

Priority 2:
- `langgraph_ada.py` → `resonance.py` (refactor)
- `brain_mesh.py` → `mesh.py`
- `qualia_learner.py`

See `docs/AGI_THINKING_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` for full details.
